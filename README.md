# Resume Builder - SOLID Principles & Bulletproof React

A modern resume builder application built with React, following SOLID principles, Bulletproof React patterns, and clean code practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### SOLID Principles Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each component has one clear responsibility
   - `PersonalInfoSection` - only handles personal info display
   - `ExperienceSection` - only handles experience display
   - `SkillsSection` - only handles skills display
   - `ResumeContainer` - orchestrates sections

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - `useResumeData` hook is open for extension (new operations) but closed for modification
   - New resume sections can be added without modifying existing code

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - `SkillsSection` can work with any skill category (technical, soft, language)
   - Components accept interfaces, not concrete implementations

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - `Button` component only includes necessary props
   - Components expose minimal, focused interfaces

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Components depend on abstractions (TypeScript interfaces) not concrete implementations
   - Data flows through well-defined interfaces

### Bulletproof React Patterns

- **Feature-based folder structure**
- **Custom hooks for state management**
- **TypeScript for type safety**
- **Reusable UI components**
- **Utility functions for business logic**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Type-safe development** with TypeScript
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Modular architecture** following SOLID principles
- **Reusable components** with clear interfaces
- **Custom hooks** for state management
- **Utility functions** for business logic

## 🧩 Components

### Core Components
- `ResumeContainer` - Main orchestrator
- `PersonalInfoSection` - Personal information display
- `ExperienceSection` - Work experience display
- `SkillsSection` - Skills categorization and display

### Shared Components
- `Button` - Reusable button component with variants

### Custom Hooks
- `useResumeData` - Resume data management

### Utilities
- `dateUtils` - Date formatting and manipulation
- `resumeData` - Sample resume data

## 🎨 Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling with:
- Responsive design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Color-coded skill proficiency levels
- Clean, professional layout

## 📝 Data Structure

The resume data follows a well-defined TypeScript interface:

```typescript
interface ResumeData {
  personalInfo: PersonalInfo;
  experience: Experience[];
  education: Education[];
  skills: Skill[];
  projects: Project[];
}
```

## 🔧 Customization

To customize the resume:
1. Update `src/constants/resumeData.ts` with your information
2. Modify components in `src/features/resume/components/`
3. Add new sections by extending the types and creating new components

## 🧪 Testing

The architecture supports easy testing:
- Components are pure and testable
- Hooks can be tested independently
- Utilities are pure functions

## 📚 Best Practices

- **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, small functions, clear structure
- **SOLID Principles**: Applied throughout the codebase
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Component Composition**: Reusable, composable components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between features

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Follow the existing architecture patterns
2. Maintain SOLID principles
3. Add TypeScript types for new features
4. Keep components small and focused
5. Write clean, readable code
